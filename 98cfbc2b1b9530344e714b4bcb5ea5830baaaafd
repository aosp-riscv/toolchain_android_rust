      "message": "What is the use case you have in mind here?  I\u0027ve never updated a patch file unless it failed to apply and I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s part of any existing workflow.  This just seems to clutter up the output with un-actionable information, and I\u0027d prefer to not making an existing workflow worse to support a hypothetical task we aren\u0027t currently doing.\n\nIf we do want this information we should probably write it to a file (e.g. `patches.log`) as it will quickly get pushed off the top of the terminal by the rest of the build.",
