      "message": "The shim has another benefit, and that is that it invokes the correct prebuilt hermetic python3 interpreter, and not just whatever python3 that env can find. I still think we want to retain the shim, but I do think that we can now update it to use `/usr/bin/env python3` instead, because `python` is frequently missing now on glinux machines. While it\u0027s a nop for the buildbots, most of us working on Android rustc still want to just do `./build.py` and not have to type out a giant command line for it.",
